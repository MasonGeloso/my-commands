You've just finished a feature. What I want you to do is go back and re-research the documentation, the implementation, every aspect of this feature and how it might affect the user. And what I want you to do is one of four things:

1. Go to the HoshiOS page and create a new section under the correct category for this feature, wherever you think it would fit best
2. Add it to the What's New section and make sure that it appears at the top and not the bottom
3. Go through the development roadmap and make sure that that's updated with this new feature
4. Write a markdown document under our socials directory

## Social Media Posts

Name the file: feature name, all lowercase with dashes for the spaces (e.g., `universe-events.md`)

The markdown file should contain:
- **Twitter/X Thread**: Start with the announcement, then explain key features, how it works, and how it affects the user
- **Reddit Post**: Official post for our subreddit
- **Discord Announcement**: Official post for our Discord

Each platform's content should be in its own section in the markdown file.

## Writing Guidelines

**Tone & Style:**
- Sound human and conversational, like an engineer wrote it
- Keep it TLDR - don't get too carried away
- Avoid overusing em dashes
- Avoid overusing comparisons
- Make it authentic and direct

**What NOT to Include:**
- Never mention specific models, technology, APIs, or technical implementation details (e.g., "Claude", "Replicate", "Flux Schnell", "LLM pipeline")
- Don't say "AI generated" - use "dynamically generated" or "procedurally generated" instead
- Avoid mentioning random numbers like "1,095 events" or "11-step pipeline"
- Keep technical secrets internal

**What TO Include:**
- Focus on how it affects the user experience
- Explain what they can do with the feature
- Show the value and impact on their companion interactions
- Always include a link to https://hoshi.chat in the CTA
