You are about to have your memory wiped!

You need to save as much context as possible on the thing(s) you are working on in your original plan file. If you don't have a plan file, please write a new markdown file for this. If you do, then append what you are working on, anything you've learned, any useful context, important files to re-read, etc. to the bottom of the markdown file.

After you've completed that, please give me a one paragraph instructional text that you will give to yourself after the memory wipe has happened. The goal of the paragraph is not instruct your future self to do next, the goal is too provide instructions on how to get _caught up_ and refresh your context. IE what md files to read, what code too look at, any extra notes, etc etc. Be thorough, as anything you leave out will be completely forgotten!
