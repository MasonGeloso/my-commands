# Diff Check
Some work has just been done and I am ready to commit it BUT, we need to make sure there is no regression. Please run `git diff` and:

## Based on the above diff and reading any relevant files, please do the following:

1. Review the diff to check for problems and bugs
2. Report if any functionality/logic was removed
3. Try to understand what the goal of the commit was and if there are any obvious holes or bugs
4. Double check if the documentation does not reflect the current changes (Do not add a "recently changed" section or anything, just make sure there is no out of date info).
5. No environment secrets hard coded
6. There are no anti-patterns that are not inline with the rest of the app

Raise any concerns/recommendations if any.
