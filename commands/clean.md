# Clean Up Time

Your job is to create a todo list for these items:
- Research and understand the codebase, both frontend and backend
- Read the documentation 
- Analyze the codebase for possibly for repeated or non-DRY code
- Find any odd anti-patterns that do not fit in with the rest of the codebase
- Present the user with a "Clean Up Report" on what needs to be sorted
