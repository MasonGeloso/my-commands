You've just had your context wiped but before that, you've saved very important context and instructions on how to get caught back up and understand what is happening. Follow these directions, read the entire md file, do some poking around the code to make sure nothing changed and tell me once you are ready to start work. No coding, no file editing, no nothing until you've caught back up with all the context.

Please do NOT try to run or import anything. The server is already running.
