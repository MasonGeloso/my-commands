You've just completed a feature or fix, and now it's time to rectify the documents. Our documents can be found in the docs directory, and your job is to add a new document if a current document doesn't exist for this fix or feature. If it's a small fix, don't bother adding a document. Then we need to add a reference to the newly created document if you decided to create one. And finally, we need to go through the current docs to rectify any information that might be incorrect or out of date because of this change. Be concise. Don't mention things like benefits or specific code details, but rather just how the system works. This is developer documentation, so it's really focused on giving as much insight to how the system works versus anything else. You don't have to talk in terms of a changelog. In other words, you don't have to say, we did it like this before and we do it like this now. You can just update the docs to reflect the most current changes. Again, I want to emphasize to not create markdown docs if it's a simple bug fix or it's a very small scoped feature. The user may instruct you to create a document or not.
